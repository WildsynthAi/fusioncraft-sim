FusionCraft — Multi-Physics Demo (Research-grade baseline)

Small, modular deterministic simulation framework:
- RK4 integrator
- Fusion 0D toy model (energy balance)
- EM oscillator model
- PID control module
- Deterministic main driver that couples modules and produces CSV time series

Run on a PC with Python:
1. pip install -r requirements.txt
2. python src/sim/main.py

This is a baseline educational/research scaffold intended to be extended.
